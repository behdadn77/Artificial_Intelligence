# Description
This project is defined by [UC Berekley ](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

As you can see there are two folders ( "_Problem_" and "_Solution_").The "_Problem_" folder consists of a bunch of codes that are already implemented for you but need to be completed by you. I have put my own implemented sample in  "_Solution_" folder. Feel free to leave me your comments. Your suggestions on any part of my code is appreciated.
